Population and Vital Statistics Reprot (various years), (5) U.S. Census Bureau: International Database, and (6) Secretariat of the Pacific Community: Statistics and Demography Programme.",Health: Reproductive health,Annual,Weighted average,"Total fertility rates are based on data on registered live births from vital registration systems or, in the absence of such systems, from censuses or sample surveys. The estimated rates are generally considered reliable measures of fertility in the recent past. Where no empirical information on age-specific fertility rates is available, a model is used to estimate the share of births to adolescents. For countries without vital registration systems fertility rates are generally based on extrapolations from trends observed in censuses or surveys from earlier years.","Reproductive health is a state of physical and mental well-being in relation to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Means of achieving reproductive health include education and services during pregnancy and childbirth, safe and effective contraception, and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age in developing countries.",Annual data series from United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects are interpolated data from 5-year period data. Therefore they may not reflect real events as much as observed data.,Relevance to gender indicator: it can indicate the status of women within households and a woman’s decision about the number and spacing of children.,,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by

It is a synthetic indicator calculated from marital status categories of men and women aged 15 to 54 at the census or survey date.","United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. World Marriage Data.",Health: Population: Dynamics,Annual,,,,"The estimates by age may be affected by age misreporting. Marital status may be misreported, particularly in societies where divorce or separation is not socially acceptable. The differences in marital status categories included over time and their definitions limit comparability of data across time and countries. Data derived from surveys with small samples are subject to sampling error.",,Note that the SMAM takes a single point in time and calculates the age at marriage from the marital status of the population aged between 15 and 50. This value is different from the mean age of marriage that is calculated from first marriage rates in a respective period (commonly used in countries with complete marriage registration systems) or cohort measures of entry into first marriage or union (based on retrospective survey questions on age at first marriage or union formation). The retrospective nature of the SMAM means that values are influenced by age and marital status specific mortality and migration.,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by

SE.SCH.LIFE.FE,CC BY-4.0,"Expected years of schooling, female","Expected years of schooling is the number of years a child of school entrance age is expected to spend at school, or university, including years spent on repetition. It is the sum of the age-specific enrolment ratios for primary, secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary education.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics (http://uis.unesco.org/),Education: Efficiency,Annual,Weighted average,"The school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrollment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates.

Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. Population data are drawn from the United Nations Population Division. Using a single source for population data standardizes definitions, estimations, and interpolation methods, ensuring a consistent methodology across countries and minimizing potential enumeration problems in national censuses.

The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example).","School life expectancy indicates the average number of years of schooling that the education system can offer. A high value indicates a probability for children to spend more years in education. Note that the expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed, because of repetition.",The expected number of years of schooling may not be comparable across countries due to different lengths of the school year and policies on repetition and promotion. It is also affected by the magnitude of children who never go to school.,,,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by
